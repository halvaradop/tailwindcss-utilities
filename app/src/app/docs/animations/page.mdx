```css
@theme {
    --animation-count-5: 5;
    --animation-range-xs: normal 25%;
    --animation-timeline-axis: scroll(scroller axis);
    --animation-fill-mode-revert: revert;
    --ease-circ: cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
    --animate-pulse: pulse 2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1) infinite;
